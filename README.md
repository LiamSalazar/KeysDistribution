# KeysDistribution
Distribution of private and public RSA keys in java, it includes a chat using a secret key distributed using RSA, the secret key is the user's choice, then it is transformed into a valid key for AES.
As a recommendation, do not use the AC that is in the code in real security projects, that is just an example, search a real AC and you can use a similar structure of my code adapted to the actual AC API.
You can apply this distribution using POO in the Kerberos 4 code that you can find on my profile.
